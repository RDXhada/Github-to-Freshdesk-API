# Github-to-Freshdesk-API
A project based on fetching Github user information and making a contact in Freshdesk using REST API
## How to run the program : 
! Note that you need to have Node JS installed (running the program) [in terminal]
! Note that you need to have Jest installed (for unit testing)[in terminal] 
1) Download the CraftDemoNodeJs file
2) There you will see a .env file, you can insert your Github and Freshdesk tokens for a more secure/authorized requeting (and more requests of course).
3) Download the packages/modules using the command : 
```bash
npm i
```
4) You can run the unit tests using :
```bash
npx jest
```
5) You can run the program with : 
```bash
node src/index.js <somebodys_github_username> <your_freshdesk_domain>
```
- Note that not using proper tokens will result in error
- Additional information/implementations is given in the PDF file
